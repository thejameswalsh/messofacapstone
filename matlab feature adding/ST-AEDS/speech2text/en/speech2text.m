% speech2text Transcribe speech signal to text
%
% The speech2text function enables you to interface with 3rd party
% cloud-based speech-to-text APIs through MATLAB. Supported 3rd party
% Speech Recognition APIs include: Google, IBM, Microsoft.
%
% To use the speech2text function, set up an account with the third
% party API as outlined in the documentation.
%
% TEXT = speech2text(clientObject,SPEECH,FS) transcribes the SPEECH,
% sampled at FS Hertz, to text by passing the data to the clientObject. The
% clientObject is an interface to a third-party API, and is an object of
% the speechClient class. The output TEXT is returned as a table that
% contains the transcription and confidence metrics. Some APIs
% provide additional outputs and are also returned in the table.
%
% TEXT = speech2text(..., 'HTTPTimeOut',TIMEOUT) specify the TIMEOUT
% value in seconds to wait for initial server connection
